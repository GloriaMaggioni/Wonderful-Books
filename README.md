#WONDERFUL BOOKS

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is an application designed to help users search for any book they want to find.
Its purpose is to bring more people closer to the fascinating and incredible world of reading by offering an easy-to-use and accessible tool that allows anyone to discover books of any genre.

HOW IT WORKS

Using a simple search bar, similar to Google's, users can type the name of a genre or the title of a book they are interested in and click the 'Search' button. The application then loads a list of books sourced from the 'OpenLibrary' server, displaying the title, cover, and author of each book.
Additionally, with another button, users can access more detailed information, including the book's trama.
